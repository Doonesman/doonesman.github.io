<h1>WARP CORE STATUS</h1>
<!-some kind of svg graphic here, like a vertical green rectangle to indicate OK->
<h1>DEUTERIUM STORAGE</h1>
<!-some svg here, I'm thinking like a gauge? There are six deuterium storage tanks, so six horizontal gauges, mostly full?->
<h1>ANTIMATTER STORAGE</h1>
<!-so, this one needs to have one graphic for status "OK", and then another one, like the gauge from deuterium, for volume. I'm not doing 155 tanks worth of gauges, apart from anything else the damn thing'd be unreadable, so just the one "fuel" gauge->
<h1>IMPULSE REACTOR STATUS</h1>
<!-now, this one will be sixteen circles marked Primary and four more marked Secondary... there's gotta be a way...right, four by four at '100' width per circle, like the launchers, means that "Primary" will be 400 units from the side, so "Seconday" just needs to be indented that far. I'll need to look into this to make sure it makes sense.->
